The issue is likely due to a mismatch between the authenticated user's UID and the data structure in the Realtime Database.  Ensure that the data you're trying to access is structured correctly within the rules.  For example, if your rules grant access based on `auth.uid`, the data should be structured like this:

```
database:
  rules:
    '.read': "auth != null",
    '.write': "auth != null"
```

Then your data should be organized under a node with the authenticated user's UID.  If the data is not structured to match the `auth.uid` check in your rules, the error will persist.  You may need to use a custom claim or other mechanisms if you need more complex access control.

Example:

```javascript
//bug.js
firebase.database().ref(`users/${firebase.auth().currentUser.uid}/data`).once('value', (snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.val());
});

//bugSolution.js
// Ensure user is authenticated and data is structured accordingly.
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
if (user) {
  // Structure data by user UID
  firebase.database().ref(`users/${user.uid}/data`).on('value', (snapshot) => {
    console.log(snapshot.val());
  });
} else {
  console.log('User not authenticated');
}
});
```
